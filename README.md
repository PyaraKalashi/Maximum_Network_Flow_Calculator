# Max Flow Computation using Edmonds-Karp Algorithm

This Java application calculates the **maximum flow in a directed network** using the **Edmonds-Karp algorithm**, a BFS-based implementation of the Ford-Fulkerson method. It reads a graph from a formatted text file, computes the maximum possible flow from a source node to a sink node, and displays detailed flow information.
