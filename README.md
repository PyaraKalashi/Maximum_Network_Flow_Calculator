# Maximum_Network_Flow_Calculator
This Java application calculates the maximum flow in a directed graph using the Edmonds-Karp algorithm. It reads graph data from a file, finds augmenting paths via BFS, and outputs the total max flow and final edge flows from source to sink. Ideal for studying flow networks.
